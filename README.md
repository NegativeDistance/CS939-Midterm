# CS939-Midterm

description

our midterm will be a project like other homework. It carries 25% of your total grade.  Please note that the Final exam project will be continuation of this project. Therefore, it is very important that you do this project correctly. Otherwise, it will impact your final exam project as well.   Please read the instructions carefully before you start writing the program.  As always, jot down the plan of your program before writing the program itself. 

 Write a program to allow the user to:

1. Create two classes. Employee and Departments.

The Department class will have: DepartmentID, Departmentname, DepartmentHeadName.

The Employee class will have employeeID, emploeename, employeesalary, employeeage, employeeDepartmentID.

Both of the above classes should have appropriate constructors, accessor methods.

 

2. Create two arrays . One for  Employee with the size 5 and another one for Department with the size 3.

 

Your program should display a menu for the user to do the following:

1. Create Department. Collect all information about a department. Make sure the department ID does not already exist in the array containing Department objects. If it does not, then insert the Department object into the array.  When the array is full, display the error message to the user "The array is full, you can not add any more departments"

2. Create Employee. Collect all information about an Employee. Make sure the Employee ID does not already exist in the array containing Employee objects. If it does not, then insert the Employee object into the array. Also make sure that the DepartmentID that the employee belongs also exists. If it does not, then display error message. 
When the array is full, display the error message to the user "The array is full, you can not add any more Employees"

3. Write the data to the file. When the user selects this option, dump the information in each array into a separate file.

4. Retrieve data from file. When user selects this option, open each file, load the data from the file into the appropriate array.

5. Display Report: When user selects this option, go through arrays and display the total salary paid for each department. The report should display the department name and the total salary of all employees in that department.
